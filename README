This is a chord chart layout for d3 that allows mulitple categorical
connections between the same two nodes, and it has a fixed width ribbon,
where the data is nominal. I needed to show where hospital associations can
share data (made-up data), and allow connections to be either categorically
colored or grayed out to signal "inactive" or broken links.
